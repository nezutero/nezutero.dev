## Who I Am

I'm Dimitri Nesterenko, a software engineer originally from Ukraine, now living in Rennes, France. I see my craft as a form of creative problem-solving, something I want to master, building meaningful solutions that help others.

I don't believe in limiting myself to a single label. Software engineering is a passion and a craft I'm constantly learning, but it's one facet of who I am, not the whole picture.

## Technical Interests

I'm drawn to algorithms and low-level stuff, the kind where you think deeply about what you do and why, hard things that require real thinking and understanding.

I value privacy and freedom, which naturally led me to Linux and the free and open source software movement. The technologies that excite me at the moment are compiled, efficient, low-level modern programming languages like Rust and Go, as well as C/C++

## Philosophy & Growth

Beyond engineering, I'm drawn to philosophy and the pursuit of living more deliberately. Nietzsche and Miyamoto Musashi have been particularly important to me, along with certain Stoic ideas. But I stay open and regularly expose myself to different philosophies. I learn from anything, with the idea of being better as a human, be stronger, understand myself and others better, learn more the world and be the best version of myself. I'm a minimalist. I value deep human connections. I find humans interesting, fascinating.

I believe in lifelong learning and doing hard things. Each day is an opportunity to grow.

## Stories & Knowledge

I love stories in all forms, mainly — books and manga. The knowledge they offer and the lessons they teach about the world, human nature, and life itself. Rather than list everything I've read, you can explore my [anime & manga library on AniList](https://anilist.co/user/nezutero), or check out my curated [library](/library) of books I've read and want to recommend—only those I consider worth sharing, the ones that taught me something meaningful.

## The Purpose of This Website

This website serves as my connector to the world. I don't use social media, but I've always wanted to express myself—so this is my public journal, where I share thoughts and experiences that I hope will be useful or interesting to someone.

I'd like to write more here, but it's impossible to cover everything, and it's never enough. The goal isn't to write a book about me and personality, which is impossible in my opinion, or to tell everything about me, which is also impossible, for better or worse. You can't really understand someone “completely” or even partially just from reading some of the incomplete and summarized stuff about them. We're all complex creatures, and I find that beautiful. So let's take our time and get to know one another the way I prefer—slowly, profoundly, and more meaningfully.

Feel free to explore my [posts](/posts) or reach out if you'd like to connect.
